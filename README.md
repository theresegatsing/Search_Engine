# Simple Search Engine (Java)

A small **console-based** search engine written in Java.  
It indexes a fixed set of documents and lets you search them using:

- Keywords  
- Exact phrases (`"search engine"`)  
- Boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`)  
- Optional sorting by **relevance** and then by **date**
